WWW-Cachet version 0.01
=======================

A simple (enough) Perl module to interface with Cachet (https://docs.cachethq.io)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  - Moo
  - LWP::UserAgent
  - LWP::Protocol::https (If your cachet uses SSL)
  - JSON
  
In order to run the tests in t/ you will need
  - Test::LWP::UserAgent

DOCUMENTATATION

I've tried for the most part to document public methods in the WWW::Cachet module using POD.
Check perldoc WWW::Cachet once installed, or perldoc lib/WWW/Cachet.pm from this directory.

EXAMPLE

Okay so you don't wanna read the perldoc for whatever reason then that's fine too, here's a starter for
ya. Godspeed.

      use Data::Dumper;
      use WWW::Cachet;

      my $cachet = WWW::Cachet->new(
        api_url   => "http://cachet.example.com/api/v1",
        api_token => "rRpHYVhsNnG12X3N4ufr"
      );

      my $component = $cachet->getComponent(1);
      die $cachet->error unless($component);

      print Dumper $component;
